# Javascript-Applications
This is the repository for the youtube series you can find [here](Link_here).

## Installation
You can run these applications by simply cloning this repository or downloading it via github and then starting a http server in the root directory and clicking on the application you wanna run. I use the [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) utility to do this.

## Contributing
You are more than welcome to hack any of the applications here and add features or improve the UI. If you have any ideas about which application I should do next, please feel free to open an issue and we can discuss more. Happy coding!  :D
